# Improving Document Submission

Submitting documents is a critical part of almost all benefits applications. Almost a third of Americans with incomes less than $30,000 rely on their phone for internet access, thus mobile-friendly applications are critical to meeting beneficiaries where they are. 
Since 2019, the adoption of mobile-responsive benefits applications has increased by 25%, improving document submission for beneficiaries. However, processing these documents remains a burden for administrators.

Once digitally submitted, documents received by an agency must be categorized, reviewed for legibility, and converted into machine-readable formats for routing to internal systems that support decision-making. While some agencies have adopted mobile-first tools to enhance the front-end application experience, the back-end process for administrators remains largely manual. As a result, mobile uploads have unintentionally increased the burden on administrators, who now must process a higher volume of documents.

Processing documents and extracting critical information to make application decisions faster and more efficiently continues to be a persistent pain point for administrators.

<b>Our proposed solution explores how we might reduce manual document processing–streamlining submission and data extraction – so administrators can focus on making rapid decisions.</b>
