# 2. Use Python backend

Date: 2025-02-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to know what backend languages will be used so that we can configure
the appropriate tooling to support it.

Example code exists that is written in Python, plus the team is familiar and
comfortable with it.

## Decision

We'll be using Python for backend development.

## Consequences

This is a POC and we expect changes.  Adopting other languages (e.g., Node)
is more likely than with an established project.  If we adpot another language,
it may be possible to include it along with Python.
